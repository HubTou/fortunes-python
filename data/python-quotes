As it seems to me, in Perl you have to be an expert to correctly make
a nested data structure like, say, a list of hashes of instances.
In Python, you have to be an idiot not to be able to do it, because you
just write it down.

Everyone knows that any scripting language shootout that doesn't show

For someone who is not yet a programmer, who wants to become a

I can grasp code much better when it's formatted properly.
Python makes that structure mandatory.

I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel
differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried
to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you.
The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.

I have learned that you can't do it alone, which is not an easy lesson
for me. I've learned that you don't always get the outcome that you went

I note that the Python folks still think they like JPython.

I think computers have made it to that point, where they're just a

I'm a little skeptical of the claim that the systems thinking is primary
there, because it's much easier to come up with an idea for a system
than it is to take an idea and turn it into working code.

I'm usually not a very visionary thinker. People always ask me, what's
next for Python, and I never know. But I put on my most visionary hat,
and assumed that it would make sense for everyone to learn programming.

If you write a prototype in Python and you get it to work, often, that’s
not a very big effort, and then you can afford to throw away your
prototype and write the same thing again based on what you've learned.
You can still write it in Python, but the second version will be much
better than the first.

If you're talking about Java in particular, Python is about the best fit
you can get amongst all the other languages. Yet the funny thing is,
from a language point of view, JavaScript has a lot in common with
Python, but it is sort of a restricted subset.

If you've invested much more time into writing and debugging code,
you're much less eager to throw it all away and start over.

In many ways, it's a dull language, borrowing solid old concepts
from many other languages & styles: boring syntax, unsurprising
semantics, few automatic coercions, etc etc. But that's one of the
things I like about Python.

In my daily work, I work on very large, complex, distributed systems
built out of many Python modules and packages. The focus is very similar
to what you find, for example, in Java and, in general, in systems
programming languages.

Mark Hammond is working in this area, with Windows Scripting Host.
It is definitely an area where Python fits almost perfectly.
That's quite independent from Java, actually.

Modern programs must handle Unicode —Python has excellent support for

My favorite language for maintainability is Python. It has simple, clean
syntax, object encapsulation, good library support, and optional named
parameters.

My own perception of that is somewhat colored by where people ask my
advice, which is still, of course, about changes to Python internals
or at least standard libraries.

Now, it's my belief that Python is a lot easier than to teach to
students programming and teach them C or C++ or Java at the same time
because all the details of the languages are so much harder.
Other scripting languages really don't work very well there either.
		-- Guido van Rossum

Python for me is incredibly visual. When I read Python, I definitely see
it as a two-dimensional structure, rather than one-dimensional, like
language. That is probably because Python uses indentation for grouping,
but probably also because my mind just likes thinking visually.

Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning,
and remains so as the system grows and evolves. Today dozens of Google

Python is now also the language of amateurs, and I mean that in the best

"Python tricks" is a tough one, cuz the language is so clean.
E.g., C makes an art of confusing pointers with arrays and strings,
which leads to lotsa neat pointer tricks; APL mistakes everything
for an array, leading to neat one-liners; and Perl confuses everything
period, making each line a joyous adventure <wink>.

Some poorly formatted text can drive me crazy. They interrupt my visual
parsing of the flow and the structure, and in that sense, I do think in
Python.

The currently prevailing theory about Python's unexpected success,
is that at some point, it established itself into data science and
machine learning, and scientific data processing in general, and once
you have critical mass, it's easier for everyone to use the same system
as their colleagues and their competitors, than to try something
different.

The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable
classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code
-- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.

The mainframe is a machine that costs many millions of dollars, and the
combined pay of all those programmers is peanuts compared to the cost of
the mainframe. But as I experienced desktop workstations and PCs,
I realized that a change of mindset about cost of the programmer's time
versus cost of the computer's time was overdue.

The typical way that we introduce Python to beginning programmers is
also important. We can show them very small snippets of code that
require very little understanding of terminology and concepts from
programming before they make sense, whereas the smallest Java program,
for example, contains a whole bunch of what are, to the uninitiated eye,
noise characters.

There are a whole bunch of common programming tasks that are easy in

There are certain introductions to programming that are fun for kids to

We will perhaps eventually be writing only small modules which are
identified by name as they are used to build larger ones, so that
devices like indentation, rather than delimiters, might become feasible
for expressing local structure in the source language.

When you choose a language, youre also choosing a community.
The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project wont be
as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in
Python. And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the
language you choose. Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer
Python to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of
those languages.
